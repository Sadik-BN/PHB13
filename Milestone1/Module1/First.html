    As a person I am Very Lazy. Addicted to social media and youtube shorts. but that doesn't mean 
    I don't want to work hard. I know I can but those bad habits not let me to do that. I need to overcome
    lazy ness and addiction. <strong> <em> I will try my best.</em></strong> <b><i>Wish me Good luck</i></b>
